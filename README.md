The music recommendation system takes in user preferences as input and recommends songs based on the similarity of their preferences to those of other users. The system uses a content- based algorithm that analyses the characteristics of songs, such as genre, artist, and tempo, to recommend similar songs to users.
Cosine similarity is used to calculate the similarity between the characteristics of songs and user preferences. The system does not have a built-in music player but instead provides users with recommendations that they can search for and listen to on their preferred music platform.
